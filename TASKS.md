# Geospatial Harmonization Tasks

This document describes the steps needed to harmonize multiple geospatial
datasets so they can be directly compared or analyzed together.  It is
tool-agnostic — the same pipeline applies whether you use command-line
utilities, Python, R, or any other stack.

---

## Input

- One or more dataset URLs (raster or vector)
- A target region of interest (state, county, custom boundary, or bounding box)
- A target coordinate reference system (CRS)
- A target spatial resolution

---

## Task 1: Validate Data Sources

Check that every dataset URL is reachable and returns actual geospatial data
(not an HTML portal page or a login screen).  If a URL fails, stop and report
which one failed before doing anything else.

---

## Task 2: Download Datasets

Download each dataset from its URL.  If a file is a compressed archive (ZIP),
extract it.  Identify the geospatial file inside each archive — look for
GeoTIFF, Shapefile, GeoJSON, GeoPackage, or NetCDF files.

---

## Task 3: Determine the Target Grid

Resolve the region of interest to a bounding box and, when available, an
actual boundary polygon.

- For US states, counties, or places, look up the boundary from an
  authoritative source (e.g. Census TIGER boundaries).
- For international or custom regions, ask the user for a boundary file or
  a bounding box in the target CRS.
- Choose an appropriate CRS: geographic (e.g. EPSG:4326) for broad areas,
  projected (e.g. a UTM zone) for local analysis that needs accurate distances.

---

## Task 4: Reproject to a Common CRS

Transform every dataset — both rasters and vectors — into the target
coordinate reference system so they all share the same spatial reference.

---

## Task 5: Clip to the Region of Interest

Crop all datasets to the target area.

- If a boundary polygon is available, clip to the actual boundary shape
  (not just the rectangular bounding box).  This avoids including data from
  neighboring regions.
- If only a bounding box is available, clip to that rectangle.

---

## Task 6: Resample Rasters to a Common Resolution

Bring all raster datasets to the same pixel size.

- Use **nearest-neighbor** resampling for categorical data (land cover classes,
  fuel model codes, soil types) — interpolating between class codes produces
  meaningless values.
- Use **bilinear** interpolation for continuous data (temperature,
  precipitation, elevation) — this preserves smooth gradients.
- If you are unsure which method to use for a dataset, ask the user.

---

## Task 7: Handle Vector Data

For each vector dataset, decide whether to:

- **Keep it as a vector** — reproject and clip to the target area, save as
  GeoJSON.  Good when you need the original geometry (fire perimeters,
  administrative boundaries).
- **Rasterize it to the target grid** — convert to a raster at the target
  resolution by burning a constant value (e.g. 1 = present, 0 = absent).
  Good for large point or polygon datasets (building footprints, road
  networks) that need to align with raster layers.

---

## Task 8: Save Harmonized Outputs

Save each harmonized dataset:

- Rasters → GeoTIFF (`.tif`)
- Vectors → GeoJSON (`.geojson`)

All outputs should share the same CRS, extent, and (for rasters) resolution.

---

## Task 9: Generate Visualization

Create a multi-panel map showing all harmonized layers side by side, saved as
a PNG image.  This gives a quick visual check that everything aligned
correctly.

---

## Task 10: Document the Work

Record what was done so the analysis is reproducible:

- The original user request
- Which datasets were used (URLs)
- Key decisions made (CRS, resolution, resampling method, rasterize vs. keep vector)
- Any issues encountered and how they were resolved
